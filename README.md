# Aero-Drop
I’m thrilled to share AeroDrop, a cutting-edge CanSat designed for atmospheric exploration and data collection. This project features three stacked circular PCBs, each with a diameter of 44mm and a central 7mm hole for secure stacking.

Top PCB:
- ESP32-WROOM-32: Central microcontroller
- AMS1117-3.3 Voltage Regulator: Efficient power management

Middle PCB:
- BMP280 Sensor: For pressure and temperature measurements
- NEO-6M GPS Module: Accurate positioning

Bottom PCB:
- 4 LEDs: Visual indicators with common ground
- SX1278 LoRa Module: Long-range communication
- MPU-6050 IMU Sensor: Motion and orientation tracking

Deployment:
AeroDrop will be deployed via a parachute, ensuring a controlled descent and stable data collection from high altitudes.
   Future Enhancements:
- Expanded Sensor Array: Integrating additional environmental sensors.
- Advanced Telemetry: Developing a real-time data visualization dashboard.
- Improved Power Efficiency: Exploring solar panel integration for sustainable energy.
- Autonomous Features: Implementing AI for autonomous decision-making.

This project has been an incredible journey in PCB design and sensor integration. I’m excited about the potential applications and eager to explore further advancements!
